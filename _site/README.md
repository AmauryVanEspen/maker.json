We are looking to develop a project metadata standard for rrbaker (and beyond) based on maker.json, which is already in fairly wide use in volunteer civic technology communities. The aim is to foster collaboration and reuse across government agencies, municipalities, and levels, and to facilitate the same with the public.

Existing standards:

* [BetaNYC maker.json](https://github.com/BetaNYC/maker.json)
* [Code for DC maker.json](http://codefordc.org/resources/specification.html)
* [Code for America API](http://codeforamerica.org/api/#project-properties)
* [18F .about.yml](https://github.com/18F/about_yml)
* [npm package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)
