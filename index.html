<h2 class="title">What is maker.json?</h2>
<p><strong>Makers API is a schema for collecting standardized information about makerspaces, an API for sharing that information, and a map to browse and sort. The goal is to connect makers around the world, helping them collaborate and co-create.</strong></p>
<br>
<p>There are a growing number of makerspaces, hackerspaces, DIY shops, innovation labs, coworking spaces, tech-enabled libraries, et cetera, all around the world, filling with people working on amazing projects from Arduinos to (RPi) Zeroes.</p>
<p>So many, in fact, it's increasingly hard to keep up. When I started looking around for lists, I found them: groups compiling data in Google Sheets, JSON files, and maps and collecting a variety of information in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>Enter the Makers API project. This includes the maker.json schema, a small file you put at the root of website or at a public repository, storing standardized information about your space, its status, who is involved, what kind of tools are available,
    and where people can learn more. Think of it as a structured "README" file.</p>
<p>What does it look like? <a href="/example">Check out an example of the maker.json specification.</a></p>
<p>From there, we've taken the first step in standardizing the information collected from so many other groups to this format, and built a structured API around this schema.</p>
