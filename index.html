            <h3>What is civic.json?</h3>
            <p>Civic.json is a metadata file (and standard) that helps people learn more about your community-centric code projects!</p>
            <p>By putting one in your project's GitHub repository, you can tell others what it's about, its status, which people and organizations are involved, and whom they can reach out to for more information.</p>
            <p>Here's an example.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="center-block form" id="how">
            <h3>How do I create one?</h3>
            <p>The <a href="/builder.html">Builder Form</a> is the easiest way to start your civic.json file.</p>
            <p>You can also use the <a href="/validator.html">Validation Tool</a> to check that your repository's civic.json file is correctly formatted.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="center-block form" id="who">
            <h3>Who is behind this?</h3>
            <p>Civic.json was originally created by Beta.NYC. We here in DC—members of the Code for DC brigade and employees of the DC Government—have extended their specification to make it easier for local governments and civic technologists collaborate on projects.</p>
