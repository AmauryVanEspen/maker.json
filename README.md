### Updates

**August 2016:** Work begins on v2 (specification as well as builder and validator, why they're down on the current site). I've partnered with the [Ananse Group](http://anansegroup.com/) -- one of the main data sources for shaping v1 -- using data fields they've worked with other groups, soliciting their feedback for a new version. Estimated release date is September 2016.

**July 2016:** Initial release and launch at MakerFaire DC.
